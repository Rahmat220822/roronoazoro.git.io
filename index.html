        <h2>About Zoro</h2>
        <p>Roronoa Zoro is a main character in the anime and manga series "One Piece." He is an incredibly strong swordsman with the dream of becoming the world's greatest swordsman. Zoro is a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, led by Monkey D. Luffy. He is known for his unique fighting style called "Santoryu" (Three Sword Style), where he wields three swords simultaneously, one in each hand and one in his mouth. Zoro is loyal, determined, and has a poor sense of direction, which often adds humor to the series. His ultimate goal is to defeat Dracule Mihawk, the world's strongest swordsman.</p>
